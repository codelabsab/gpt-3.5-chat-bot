# GPT 3.5 Turbo Chat Bot

Forked from https://github.com/notunderctrl/gpt-3.5-chat-bot.git .

This is a simple Discord chat bot built using discord.js and the gpt-3.5-turbo model from Open AI. This is the same model used for the popular chatbot Chat GPT.

We have modified it a bit to only respond to @mentions.
